# About

Claus Gaarde Pedersen is a long time mainframe developer making systems in the fields of danish real estate evaluation and taxation. Now developing a strong taste to jump into every subject about data.   
Especially to visualize data so it can be used interactively. In fact is of the opion that visualized data, that is not interactive is very boring!  
Its like, you go to the zoo to play with the tiger, not just to watch it! Right?  

This will be the place where i can show some of the interesting things i play with. It will mostly be done with R, and shown through htmlwidgets, because this is how the data can come alive.
